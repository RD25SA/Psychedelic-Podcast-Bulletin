Welcome back to the Impact Psychedelics podcast. I'm your co-founder and head impact integration coach. At Impact Psychedelics, we help you combine cognitive behavioral coping skills with a deep understanding of the law of attraction so that you can harness the power of your mind and transform your life. Not only are you going to be able to see results in a stronger and healthier brain, but you'll also be manifesting from a place of vibrational alignment. So you'll be able to create and co-create a new reality. In this episode, we are going to demystify meditation and manifestation. The cool thing about the new world and the new earth is that it's all about having fun and really getting into alignment instead of creating like such an intense practice that you have to do. This is more about you breathing to the beat of your favorite song and creating and building new neural networks in your mind. So if you've never meditated before, this is for you. If you've been meditating for a long time and you want to spice up your practice, you've also come to the right place. I love having a beginner's mindset. I've been practicing meditation for over 10 years and I always find new ways to spice it up and make it fun, but it's also just a very simple and easy practice to return back to. Whenever I sit down on my meditation cushion and drop into my meditation, I feel a deep sense of ease, but it wasn't always that way. When I first started, I would sit down and I would literally be freaking out like, why can't I get my mind to soften and quiet? Why is this so hard for me? I had that quote-unquote ADHD brain and I was very wrapped up in the squirrel thoughts. You know what I'm talking about. Just constantly having your mind asking you questions and thinking about stories of the past and anticipating the future. So this episode is going to teach you how to sit with those crazy thoughts and just allow yourself to start to notice your breath. And it's not about stopping the thoughts, it's really about becoming the observer of the thoughts because you'll never stop the thoughts, but you will become really hyper aware of what you're thinking so that instead of just taking misaligned action, thinking thoughts, and doing things just to do it, you're going to get off of the hamster wheel and you're going to be able to look at your life and you're going to be able to take a couple deep breaths and act from a place of higher consciousness, of deep awareness. In Sanskrit, the word avidya refers to the branches of unconsciousness. So incorrect comprehension. Essentially meaning when the ego comes out and you start thinking thoughts about I, I, I, and me, me, me, Christina needs this, Christina needs that, all of these things that just you're trying to protect yourself or you're trying to get what you want, that is a level of incorrect comprehension because you're unable to see what's really going on. You're only projecting your own egoic mindset onto whatever the situation is so you're not seeing or thinking clearly. The second branch of avidya is going to be the energy of attachment. So feeling like you're attached to the outcome, like I'm only doing this because I think I'm gonna get this out of it. That creates a level of incorrect comprehension. And then the third is rejection. So you're rejecting something because you think that you don't like it and this actually comes up a lot with meditation where people are like they reject the meditation practice because they're like I can't do it, I can't calm my mind. And so that's just incorrect comprehension. You believe that you can't do something because the unhealed society that raised you taught you that you couldn't. And now you're continuing to perpetuate that story and now you're saying you don't want to do something because you don't think you can do it. So rejection, rejecting something. And then the fourth branch of avidya of incorrect comprehension is going to be this energy of fear. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt fud energy. You're afraid that something's not gonna go your way. You're thinking thoughts of how am I gonna save myself or keep myself safe? The fight, flight, or freeze response? The sympathetic nervous system that we talk about all the time. So you're gonna start to notice when you sit down in meditation these four things are gonna show up. The ego thoughts, thoughts of you know wanting to reject meditation because you're listening to your ego, thoughts of attachment to the outcome. Am I ever gonna be able to do this right? Am I ever gonna be able to calm my mind? Like I want my mind to be a safe comfortable place to live and I don't know if I can do it. And then the energy of course of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. So your practice is really just about being like okay I'm aware that these are the thoughts that are gonna start to come up and this is the way that this practice works. You got to be okay with not being good at something right off the bat. If you're gonna do something you got to sit into the discomfort of those beginner moments and those beginner moments are the most powerful because they're the ones that allow you to really start to hone the craft that you're practicing. And meditation is a practice that will serve every single aspect of your life because instead of acting from an unconscious place of just thinking a thought and then doing whatever the monkey mind tells you to do, whatever the ego tells you to do, whatever the fear tells you to do, whatever the rejection tells you to do, whatever the attachment tells you to do, when you're taking action from those places in Sanskrit we call this an energy of dukkha and the gunas refer to taking an action out of incorrect comprehension. So either there's going to be an action that you're going to take that's essentially going to blow up your personal game and fuck your life up and then you're gonna have to put fires out because of it later or you're gonna freeze and you're gonna have analysis paralysis and you're not gonna be able to take action towards your goals. So the reactive nature is referred to as this like oh my gosh I have to do something to save myself and the repressed nature is not doing anything because you're scared. So when you sit in meditation it's not just about like okay I'm gonna count my breath and create new neural networks in my mind although of course you are doing that but it's really truly the deeper practice and the deeper meaning of meditation is so that you can become conscious of this avidya, incorrect comprehension, and then you can notice that oh I have a tendency to react in a really aggressive nature when I'm scared or oh when this kind of a situation arises I don't take any action because I'm scared and then that stops me from being able to reach my goals. So this is about you studying yourself and in Sanskrit we call this svaryaya and this is all related back to the deep ancient practice of yoga and as you guys know I'm the founder of EDM yoga and yoga as a philosophy and as a beautiful ancient practice actually has eight limbs and the physical movement is only one of those eight limbs the rest is about really understanding the workings of the mind and living your life from a place of vibrational alignment and within my practice what I like to do is I combine yoga with the law of attraction and with astrology and human design and gene keys so that not only are you moving trauma and energy through your body through the movement and the breath work but you're also understanding the dynamics of your own chart in astrology you're understanding the plan that you made before you came here to planet earth you're remembering your purpose you're remembering how to heal yourself you're unlearning fear-based perspectives and so meditation is so much more than just sitting down closing your eyes and stopping the thought no meditation is about listening to the thoughts that you're having and understanding why you're having the thoughts that you're having and how you can act from a place of alignment instead of reacting or repressing your actions due to incorrect comprehension so let's take a moment to drop into meditation together go ahead and soften your eyes to close and start to deepen your breath obviously if you're in the car don't close your eyes you can do this with your eyes open as well just start to notice the breath and the way that it feels as you breathe in through your nose and breathe out of your mouth inhale through the nose exhale out of the mouth and notice how the breath just taps you in and allows you to recalibrate into your body so I like to think of the breath as you essentially pressing the do not disturb button in your mind and then as the breath becomes stronger and the connection becomes deeper now do not disturb is on and the outside world can't touch you and so you feel just this wave of peace wash over you and then from there you start to notice as the breath gets deeper and as you feel safer and safer inside of your body you start to feel like you've okay now I'm actually tapped into the universal source energy Wi-Fi universal source energy us energy is the energy of the ever-present love within and around you all of your angels all of the Saints your ancestors your loved ones everyone coming together to support you feeling that loving presence of vibrational alignment all around you and then you just listen just listen to whatever thoughts are coming up in your mind and as you become the observer of those thoughts you'll start to notice patterns and that's where journaling comes in you can start to write down like what are the most prominent thoughts that I'm having maybe you're having a theme with food and you're having an attachment to food and you hear yourself saying what am I having for dinner later or you know when do I get to eat next or oh god I feel like I ate too much in my last meal my stomach hurts or I'm mad at myself for saying this that or the other thing you're gonna start to recognize these patterns of thoughts because you have about 70,000 thoughts per day and most of them are the same ones on replay and so when you start to notice oh my gosh I'm thinking all of these thoughts on replay and they're making me feel shitty then you can say you know what I'm gonna make a conscious effort to change the story that I'm telling myself in my mind because I get to write the script in my life so really really focus on how can you just observe the thoughts without trying to change them at first write them down and then do what we do in our patient portal which is we create either an energy of prison or castle thoughts or now what we're referring to in a more technology basis would be virus thoughts and security thoughts the virus thoughts are the energy of fear-based thought patterns that probably aren't even your own they're probably thought patterns that you learned from the unhealed society that raised you so this is always about you harnessing the power of your mind to transform the way that you are showing up in the world because manifestation is all about showing up as the person who has everything that you want and so it's not about wanting something and then manifesting it but it's actually about wanting to become the person who knows what you need to know to be able to receive the thing that you want so you need to become the vibrational frequency how do you do that you listen to your thought patterns and you stop showing up as the scared resentful freaking out version of yourself and you start to become the coolest most likable most aligned version of yourself so that's why the meditation practice feeds into literally everything in your life because if you can calm the mind and stop acting from incorrect comprehension and start to act from a place of vibrational alignment now you're manifesting from pure positive energy which means that you're going to be attracting more pure positive energy into your life I know this helped and served you so thank you so much for being here my name is Christina Joy and I'm here to help you literally change the way
